Printing is a simple way to write text to the console.
There are a few ways to print.

For example, if you want to print a string, you would use the 'print' keyword, followed by a string:
print "string"

To print a variable, you would use the print keyword followed by the variable name surrounded in dashes:
print -variable-

To print the value of a MACRO, you would use the print keyword followed by the macro name surrounded in "~":
print ~macro~

And that's all there is to it!
I hope this helped.
