Escape sequences are mostly involved with print statements and they are quite useful.
The only functional escape sequence is -nl- (newline), and it only works in print statements.

To print a newline, you'd use the print keyword followed by the newline sequence in a string:

print "-nl-"

And that's all there is to it!
I hope this helped.
