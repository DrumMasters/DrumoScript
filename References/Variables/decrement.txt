Decrementation is an integer-variable-exclusive feature, allowing you to change the value of an integer variable by 1.

To decrement a variable, you'd use the '--' keyword followed by the variable's name (and optionally how much you want to decrement it by):
-- variable (optionalValue)

And that's all there is to it!
I hope this helped.

If you need any more help, just ask in the chat!
