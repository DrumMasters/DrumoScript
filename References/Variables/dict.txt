Dictionaries are a way of storing multiple key-value pairs in a single variable.

To declare a dictionary, you'd use the "dict" keyword followed by the dictionary name and its key-value pairs (separated by dashes):
dict dictionaryname key value - key value

And that's all there is to it!
I hope this helped.
