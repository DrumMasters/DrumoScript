Incrementation is an integer-variable-exclusive feature, allowing you to change the value of an integer variable by 1.

To increment a variable, you'd use the '++' keyword followed by the variable's name (and optionally how much you want to increment it by):
++ variable (optionalValue)

And that's all there is to it!
I hope this helped.
