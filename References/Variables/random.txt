Randomness is an integer-variable-exclusive way to generate a random number.

To make an integer variable with a random value, you'd declare the variable and use the 'rand' keyword followed by 2 numbers (the minimum and maximum value):

int variable rand (number 1) (number 2)

And that's all there is to it!
I hope this helped.
